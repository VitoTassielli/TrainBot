# TrainBot
TrainBot was developed to personal use. There is no affiliation with anyone.

## Description
Born in October 2019 due to difficulty of buying the train ticket of Torino Porta Nuova to Bari Stazione Centrale during the Christmas Holidays, TrainBot checks every interval if the desired train trip is available to be bought. If it is, it's sent a message on Telegram Channel to notify the customer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- `requests` module
